    <p><strong>Nigiri sushi</strong> is that familiar style of sushi made up of an oval-shaped mound of rice with a slice of <em>(usually)</em> raw fish on top. The word nigiri comes from the Japanese nigirizushi, which translates as "hand-pressed sushi." </p>

        <li><strong>3 slices</strong> Fresh Salmon</li>
        <li><strong>3 slices</strong> Boiled Octopus</li>

        <li>Toasted Nori Seaweed</li>
        <li>Cucumbers</li>
        <li>Sushi Ginger Gari <small>(japanese pickled ginger)</small></li>
        <li>Wasabi</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
    </ul> 
    <p><small>1 tablespoon (tbsp) = 15 ml, 1 teaspoon (tsp) = 5 ml</small></p>
    <br>
  <h2>INSTRUCTIONS:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>First, slice the boiled octopus using a diagonal cut.</li>
      <li>This is fresh tuna belly also known as chutoro. Slice it across the grain to give it a better texture. Chutoro has a moderate amount of fat and will deliciously melt in your mouth.</li>
      <li>Slice the fresh salmon diagonally. In Japan, salmon has become as popular as tuna but the price has risen considerably in recent years.</li>
      <li>This is tamagoyaki, Japanese sweet omelette. Cut off a 5mm (0.2”) slice of tamagoyaki.</li>
      <li>Next, add the rice vinegar to the ice water. The vinegar has a sterilizing effect and wetting your hands will help keep the rice from sticking to them.</li>
      <li>Put a small amount of wasabi on the sushi rice.</li>
      <li>And place 2 amaebi shrimp onto it.</li>
      <li>Likewise, place the octopus slice onto the rice. Gently press the octopus and the rice together.</li>
      <li>Next, make the Gunkanmaki for the salmon roe also known as ikura. Wrap the side of the rice with the nori strip. With a rice grain, close the end of the nori.</li>
      <li>Garnish with the cucumber slices. And spoon the ikura onto it.</li>
      <li>Wet your hands again and loosely shape about 20g (0.7 oz) of sushi rice into a ball. Hold the tuna slice with another hand and add the wasabi to it.</li>
      <li>Then, place the rice onto the tuna and flip it over.</li>
      <li>Arrange the shape to give the sushi its signature look.</li>
      <li>Likewise, make the salmon sushi. You can also sear the salmon or top with sliced onion and mayonnaise.</li>
      <li>Finally, shape the rice into an oval. Place the tamagoyaki onto it.</li>
      <li>Wrap the sushi with the 12cm (4.7”) nori strip crosswise.</li>
      <li>Gari, sliced ginger root pickled with sweet vinegar is considered an essential condiment for sushi presentation. Ginger has a sterilizing effect and will also help to warm you up.</li>
    </ol>
