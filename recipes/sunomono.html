    <p>A Classic Japanese Cucumber Salad for Your Everyday Meal. In Japan, this type of side dish or salad is called <strong>Sunomono</strong>, which translated to <em>“vinegar food”</em>. The Japanese believe vinegar is an important part of our diet due to its many benefits such as controlling blood sugar levels. The most typical sunomono includes thinly sliced cucumber and wakame seaweed dressed in rice vinegar, soy sauce, and sugar. We tend to overlook the health benefits of cucumbers, but they are actually high in fiber and great for digestion.</p>
