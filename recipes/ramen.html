      <h4>Notes</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Submerge the eggs in 2 inches of cool water in a pot on the stove-top. Gradually bring them to a gentle boil.</li>
          <li>Set a timer for 6 minutes, use a slotted spoon to remove them immediately after.</li>
          <li>Rinse them under cool running water to stop the cooking process, then peel and slice in half lengthwise.</li>
        </ul>
      <br>
    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms. Sauté until golden, about 4 minutes. Remove and set aside so that they retain the color, flavor, and texture.</li>
        <li>Slice the chicken in half lengthwise to create 2 thinner slices. Cover with saran wrap and use the textured side of a meat mallet to pound it to ½ inch thick.</li>
        <li>Pat the chicken dry and season each side with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining olive oil and butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken in batches for 4-5 minutes per side, until a golden crust has developed. Set aside turn the heat off. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes, then cut into strips of desired size.</li>
        <li>Add the wine and set the heat to medium. Use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the skillet. Let the wine bubble gently and reduce by half, 4-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the butter and garlic and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken broth, soy sauce, hot sauce, honey, sesame oil, and soup seasonings. Bring to a gentle boil and let the broth reduce and concentrate for 10 minutes while you soft boil eggs for serving (see notes for instructions).</li>
        <li>Bring the soup to a more rapid boil, add the Ramen, and cook for 1 minute. Reduce to a gentle simmer and add the Bok Choy along with the cooked mushrooms and chicken. Simmer until the noodles are done, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer to serving bowls and top with green onions, roughly chopped peanuts, and a soft-boiled egg.</li>
      </ol>
